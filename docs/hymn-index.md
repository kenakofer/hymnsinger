Brethren We Have Met To Worship
</a></td>
<td class='lyric-box'>Brethren we have met to worship and adore the Lord our God.
Will you pray with all your power while we try to preach the word?
All is vain unless the Spirit of the holy One comes down.
Brethren pray, and holy manna will be showered all around.

Sisters, will you come and help us? Moses' sisters aided him.
Will you help the trembling mourners who are struggling hard with sin?
Tell them all about the Savior. Tell them that he will be found.
Sisters pray, and holy manna will be showered all around.

Is there here a trembling jailer, seeking grace and filled with fears?
Is there here a weeping Mary pouring forth a flood of tears?
Brethren join your cries to help them, sisters, let your prayers abound!
Pray, oh pray, that holy manna will be showered all around.

Let us love our God supremely, let us love each other too.
Let us love and pray for sinners till our God makes all things new.
Christ will call us home to heaven. At his table we'll sit down.
Christ will gird himself and serve us with sweet manna all around.

Come Thou Long Expected Jesus
</a></td>
<td class='lyric-box'>Come, thou longexpected Jesus! born to set thy people free,
from our fears and sins release us, let us find our rest in thee.
Israel's strength and consolation, hope of all the earth thou art,
dear desire of evry nation, joy of ev'ry longing heart.

Born thy people to deliver, born a child, and yet a King,
born to reign in us forever, now thy gracious kingdom bring.
By thine own eternal Spirit, rule in all our hearts alone.
By thine allsufficient merit, raise us to thy glorious throne.

Break Forth
</a></td>
<td class='lyric-box'>Break forth, O beauteous heav'nly light, and usher in the morning.
O shepherds, shrink not with affright, but hear the angel's warning.
This child, now weak in infancy, our confidence and joy shall be,
the power of Satan breaking, our peace eternal making.

For The Beauty Of Our Earth
</a></td>
<td class='lyric-box'>For the beauty of our earth, for the glory of the skies,
for the love which from our birth over and around us lies:

  Mother Earth, to thee we raise this our hymn of grateful praise.

For the beauty of each hour of the day and of the night,
hill and vale and tree and flow'r, sun and moon and stars of light:

For the joy of ear and eye, for the heart and mind's delight,
For the 'me', 'myself', and 'I', conscious links to sound and sight:

For the joy of human care, sibling, partner, parent, child,
friends we've lost and friends still here, for all selfless thoughts and mild:

For thy Truth both harsh and kind, shadowed setter of our stage,
patterns sought by human mind, guiding us from age to age,
