a bulwark never failing.
Our helper he amid the flood
of mortal ills prevailing,

for still our ancient foe doth seek to work us woe.
His craft and pow'r are great, and arm'd with cruel hate,
on earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide,
our striving would be losing,
were not the right one on our side,
the one of God's own choosing.

Dost ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he!
Lord Sabaoth, his name, from age to age the same,
and he must win the battle.

And though this world, with devils filled,
should threaten to undo us,
we will not fear, for God hath willed
his truth to triumph through us.

The prince of darkness grim, we tremble not for him.
His rage we can endure, for lo, his doom is sure.
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly pow'rs,
no thanks to them, abideth.
The Spirit and the gifts are ours,
through him who with us sideth.

Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also.
The body they may kill, God's truth abideth still.
His kingdom is forever.

When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

Thou on my head in early youth didst smile,
And though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,
Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee.
On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

My company before is gone, and I am left alone with thee.
With thee all night I mean to stay, and wrestle till the break of day.

I need not tell thee who I am, my misery and sin declare.
Thyself has called me by my name, look on thy hands and read it there.
But who, I ask thee, who art thou? Tell me thy name and tell me now.

In vain thou strugglest to get free;
I never will unloose my hold.
Art thou the Man that died for me?
The secret of thy love unfold.
Wrestling, I will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

Wilt thou not yet to me reveal
thy new, unutterable name?
Tell me, I still beseech thee, tell,
to know it now resolved I am.
Wrestling, I will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

'Tis all in vain to hold thy tongue
or touch the hollow of my thigh.
Though every sinew is unstrung,
out of my arms thou shalt not fly.
Wrestling, I will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

What though my shrinking flesh complain
and murmur to contend so long,
I rise superior to my pain;
when I am weak then I am strong,
and when my all of strength shall fail
I shall with the God-man prevail.

My strength is gone, my nature dies,
I sink beneath thy weighty hand,
faint to revive, and fall to rise.
I fall, and yet by faith AI stand,
I stand and will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

Yield to me now - for I am weak
but confident in self-despair!
Speak to my heart, in blessing speak,
be conquered by my instant prayer.
Speak, or thou never hence shalt move,
and tell me if thy name is Love.

'Tis Love! 'tis Love! thou diedst for me,
I hear thy whisper in my heart.
The morning breaks, the shadows flee,
pure, universal Love thou art.
To me, to all, thy mercies move -
thy nature, and thy name is Love.

My prayer hath power with God;
the grace unspeakable I now receive!
Through faith I see thee face to face,
I see thee face to face, and live!
In vain I have not wept and strove -
thy nature, and thy name is Love.

Contented now upon my thigh
I halt, till life's short journey end.
All helplessness, all weakness I
on thee alone for strength depend,
nor have I power from thee to move.
Thy nature, and thy name is Love!

There no foes nor storms assail me, while within the cleft I hide.

  Jesus, blessed Rock of ages, I will hide myself in thee.

Long pursued by sin and Satan, weary, sad, I longed for rest.
Then I found this heav'nly shelter, opened in my Savior's breast.

  Now I'm resting, sweetly resting, in the cleft once made for me.
  Jesus, blessed Rock of ages, I will hide myself in thee.

Wehrlos und verlassen sehnt sich oft mein Herz nach stiller Ruh';
doch du deckest mit dem Fittich deiner Liebe sanft mich zu.

  Unter deinem sanften Fittich find' ich Frieden, Trost und Ruh';
  denn du schirmest mich so freundlich, schützest mich und deckst mich zu.

Drückt mich Kummer, Müh' und Sorge, meine Zuflucht bist nur du,
rettest mich aus allen Ängsten, tröstest mich und deckst mich zu.

  Unter deinem sanften Fittich find' ich Frieden, Trost und Ruh';
  denn du schirmest mich so freundlich, schützest mich und deckst mich zu.

Peace which passeth understanding,
joy the world can never give,
now in Jesus, I am finding;
in his smiles of love I live.

In the rifted Rock I'll hide me,
till the storms of life are past
all secure in this blest refuge,
heeding not the fiercest blast.

Sicher bin ich und geborgen,
denn bei dir ist süße Ruh';
mag es auch im Leben stürmen,
Herr, dein Fittich deckt mich zu.

Kommt dann meine letzte Stunde,
geh' ich ein zur ew'gen Ruh';
und du deckst mit deinen Flügeln
ewiglich dein Kindlein zu.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by.
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light;
the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above,
while mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wond'ring love.
O morning stars, together proclaim the holy birth!
and praises sing to God the King, and peace to all the earth!

How silently, how silently, the wondrous gift is giv'n!
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of the heav'ns.
No ear may hear his coming, but in this world of sin,
where meek souls will receive him still the dear Christ enters in.

O holy Child of Bethlehem, descend to us we pray,
cast out our sin, and enter in, be born in us today!
We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell.
O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Immanuel!

For us he prayed, for us he taught. for us his daily works he wrought,

forbidden by your God and creed, respected since your youth:
''Prodigal, I'll fight in you, restore your faith to thrive.
I'll bring you back within the fold. Without you can't survive.
Without you can't survive!''

''You'd loose the bond of family!'' your instinct diatribes.
Decide: Be shunned to wilderness, or rest in harmless lies.
Act against evolvéd traits? Your logic might agree,
but in your gut, you crave not truth, you crave community.
You crave community!

If earthly fears don't faze you, try a sample of Pascal:
A slim chance of eternal bliss is worth more than your all.
Walk along the Roman Road, avoid eternal pain.
Salvation's path is markéd well, with brimstone in the drain,
with brimstone in the drain:

Step one: believe, O wretch, your life is worthless, justly lost,
and second: faith's your only hope, at seemingly no cost!
Third, since faith is proved by work, pay up in duties due:
Two hands on plow, and don't look back, for Brother's watching you.
Your God is watching you!

Mere reason of one mind can't win; the test of time is passed.
Religions of today are the religions fit to last.
Members true through power, fear, or friendly company
rebuke again their wayward young, ''Eat not from yonder tree.''
''Eat not from yonder tree!''

Many and great, O God, are your works, maker of earth and sky.
Your hands have set the heavens with stars; your fingers spread the mountains and plains
Lo, at your word the waters were formed; deep seas obey your voice.

Grant unto us communion with you, O starabiding One.
Come unto us and dwell with us; with you are found the gifts of life.
Bless us with life that has no end, eternal life with you.

Born a King on Bethlehem's plain,

King forever, ceasing never,

Frankincense to offer have I;
incense owns a deity nigh;
prayer and praising, voices raising,
worshiping God on high.

  O star of wonder, star of light,
  star with royal beauty bright,
  westward leading still proceeding,
  guide us to thy perfect light.

Myrrh is mine; its bitter perfume
breathes a life of gathering gloom;
sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying,
sealed in the stonecold tomb.

  O star of wonder, star of light,
  star with royal beauty bright,
  westward leading still proceeding,
  guide us to thy perfect light.

Glorious now behold him arise;
King and God and sacrifice:
Alleluia, Alleluia,
sounds through the earth and skies.

  guide us to thy perfect light.
