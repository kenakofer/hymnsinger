Tis A Gift To Be Simple
</a></td>
<td class='lyric-box'>'Tis a gift to be simple, 'tis a gift to be free,
'tis a gift to come down where we ought to be.
And when we find ourselves in the place just right
'twill be in the valley of love and delight.

When true simplicity is gained,
to bow and to bend we will not be ashamed;
to turn, turn, will be our delight,
till by turning, turning we come round right.

Breath On Me Breath Of God
</a></td>
<td class='lyric-box'>Breathe on me, breath of God. Fill me with life anew
that I may love what thou dost love, and do what thou wouldst do.

Breath on me, breath of God, un-til my heart is pure,
until with thee I will one will, to do and to endure.

Breathe on me, breath of God, till I am wholly thine,
till all this earthly part of me glows with thy fire divine.

Breath on me, breath of God, so shall I never die,
but live with thee the perfect life of thine eternity.

Brethren We Have Met To Worship
</a></td>
<td class='lyric-box'>Brethren we have met to worship and adore the Lord our God.
Will you pray with all your power while we try to preach the word?
All is vain unless the Spirit of the holy One comes down.
Brethren pray, and holy manna will be showered all around.

Sisters, will you come and help us? Moses' sisters aided him.
Will you help the trembling mourners who are struggling hard with sin?
Tell them all about the Savior. Tell them that he will be found.
Sisters pray, and holy manna will be showered all around.

Is there here a trembling jailer, seeking grace and filled with fears?
Is there here a weeping Mary pouring forth a flood of tears?
Brethren join your cries to help them, sisters, let your prayers abound!
Pray, oh pray, that holy manna will be showered all around.

Let us love our God supremely, let us love each other too.
Let us love and pray for sinners till our God makes all things new.
Christ will call us home to heaven. At his table we'll sit down.
Christ will gird himself and serve us with sweet manna all around.

How A Faith Survives
</a></td>
<td class='lyric-box'>I've grown concerned as I look on. I see you doubt the truth,
the covenant that your faith, your church, imparted in your youth.
Prodigal, I'll work in you, ensure your faith still thrive.
I'll bring you back within the fold. Without you can't survive.
Without you can't survive!

"You doubt your very family!" your instincts diatribe.
Decide: Be shunned to wilderness, or live a harmless lie
Choose against evolvéd traits? Your logic may agree,
but I, your gut, crave not the truth, I crave community.
I crave community!

Is instinct unpersuasive? Try a sample of Pascal:
A slim chance of eternal bliss is worth more than your all.
Take a page from Paul's Epistles, dodge eternal pain.
Salvation's path is markéd well, with brimstone in the drain.
With brimstone in the drain!

To start: believe, O wretch, your life is worthless, justly lost,
and second: faith's your only hope, at seemingly no cost!
Third: pay up in duties due (for faith is proved by work).
Redeem more souls tomorrow. Brother's watching if you shirk.
God's watching if you shirk!

Mere reason of one mind can't win; the test of time is passed.
Religions of today are the religions fit to last.
Members true through power, fear, or friendly company
instill again in children's minds, "Don't eat from yonder tree."
"Don't eat from yonder tree!"

Come Thou Long Expected Jesus
</a></td>
<td class='lyric-box'>Come, thou longexpected Jesus! born to set thy people free,
from our fears and sins release us, let us find our rest in thee.
Israel's strength and consolation, hope of all the earth thou art,
dear desire of evry nation, joy of ev'ry longing heart.

Born thy people to deliver, born a child, and yet a King,
born to reign in us forever, now thy gracious kingdom bring.
By thine own eternal Spirit, rule in all our hearts alone.
By thine allsufficient merit, raise us to thy glorious throne.

Help Us To Help Each Other Lord
</a></td>
<td class='lyric-box'>Help us to help each other, Lord,
each other's cross to bear,
let each his friendly aid afford,
and feel another's care.

Up into thee, our living head,
let us in all things grow,
and by thy sacrifice be led
the fruits of love to show.

Touched by the lodestone of thy love
let all our hearts agree;
and ever toward each other move,
and ever move toward thee.

This is the bond of perfectness,
thy spotless charity.
O let us still, we pray, possess
the mind that was in thee.

Break Forth
</a></td>
<td class='lyric-box'>Break forth, O beauteous heav'nly light, and usher in the morning.
O shepherds, shrink not with affright, but hear the angel's warning.
This child, now weak in infancy, our confidence and joy shall be,
the power of Satan breaking, our peace eternal making.

For The Beauty Of Our Earth
</a></td>
<td class='lyric-box'>For the beauty of our earth, for the glory of the skies,
for the love which from our birth over and around us lies:

  Mother Earth, to thee we raise this our hymn of grateful praise.

For the beauty of each hour of the day and of the night,
hill and vale and tree and flow'r, sun and moon and stars of light:

For the joy of ear and eye, for the heart and mind's delight,
For the 'me', 'myself', and 'I', conscious links to sound and sight:

For the joy of human care, sibling, partner, parent, child,
friends we've lost and friends still here, for all selfless thoughts and mild:

For thy Truth both harsh and kind, shadowed setter of our stage,
patterns sought by human mind, guiding us from age to age,
