# Welcome to Hymn Singer

Music can be more inviting and better presented, especially the *oldies-but-goodies* found in dusty hymn books. One shouldn't need a music degree to learn and enjoy these musical works, nor should one need a law degree to feel safe singing, distributing, and modifying them.

### No cost, no accounts, no catch, just ðŸŽµ that wants to be free!

This site provides **full sheet music** and **in-browser playback** on every song's page. If you'd like to learn one of the voice parts to a song, you can **adjust individual volume levels** to hear certain part more loudly. If you need resources for a service, we have **PDFs** and **Powerpoint Slides** handy.

Check out the [Full Index of songs]({{ site.baseurl }}/hymn-index.html).

### How it's done

We "typeset" songs using [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/). Lilypond turns a musical code file into various output files which are used on the site. For example, after 15 minutes adding this [one file](https://github.com/kenanbit/hymn-singer/blob/main/lilypond/songs/joyful_joyful/joyful_joyful.ly) describing "Joyful, joyful, we adore thee" to the mix, we get:
 - 4 PDFs
 - 3 PNGs
 - 1 MIDI
 - 1 MP3
 - 1 _beautifully formatted, verse-by-verse slideshow presentation_
 - 1 [sleek webpage here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link listing/joyful_joyful.md %}) on the site to display, play, and download.

Check out the [Getting Started]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link contributing.md %}) guide to learn the ropes yourself. (We are always open to having more contributors!)
