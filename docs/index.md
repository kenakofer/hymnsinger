# Welcome to Hymn Singer

Music can be more inviting and better presented, especially the *dusty old harmonies* in hymnals. One shouldn't need a music degree to learn and enjoy these musical works, nor should one need a law degree to feel safe performing, distributing, and modifying it.

### No ads, no catch, just ðŸŽµ that wants to be free!

This site provides **full sheet music** and **in-browser playback** on every song's page. If you'd like to learn one of the voice parts to a song, you can **adjust individual volume levels** to hear certain part more loudly.

Check out the [Full Hymn Index]({{ site.baseurl }}/hymn-index.html).

### How it's done

I "typeset" songs using [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/). Lilypond turns a musical code file into PDF, PNG, and MIDI files which are all provided here for download. Of course, check out the [github project](https://github.com/kenanbit/hymn-singer) to view the source files for the songs and make your own changes.

Or, use this form to [request an added song](https://forms.gle/Qp4bG7xFFih38bsW7). Ensure that:
 1. The copyright is permissive or it is in public domain
 1. You can provide a link or quality photo for the sheet music

Or, [Typeset a hymn yourself]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link contributing.md %}), and get it added here. Collaborators are great!

**Regarding copyright**, the hymns hosted here have, to the best of my knowledge, no copyright restriction. Please reach out if I have erred and included a restricted work.
