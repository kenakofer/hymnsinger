Let our rejoicing rise high as the list'ning skies,

Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us.
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us.

Stony the road we trod, bitter the chast'ning rod,
felt in the days when hope unborn had died,
yet with a steady beat, have not our weary feet
come to the place for which our people sighed?

We have come over a way that with tears has been watered.
We have come, treading our path thro' the blood of the slaughtered,

out of the gloomy past till now we stand at last
where the bright gleam of our bright star is cast.

God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,
thou who hast brought us thus far on the way,
thou who hast by thy might, led us into the light,
keep us forever in the path, we pray.

Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met thee,
lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget thee,

shadowed beneath thy hand, may we forever stand,
true to our God, true to our native land.

Stony the road we trod, bitter the chast'ning rod,
felt in the days when hope unborn had died,
yet with a steady beat, have not our weary feet
come to the place for which our people sighed?

We have come over a way that with tears has been watered.
We have come, treading our path thro' the blood of the slaughtered,

out of the gloomy past till now we stand at last
where the bright gleam of our bright star is cast.

God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,
thou who hast brought us thus far on the way,
thou who hast by thy might, led us into the light,
keep us forever in the path, we pray.

Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met thee,
lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget thee,

shadowed beneath thy hand, may we forever stand,
true to our God, true to our native land.
