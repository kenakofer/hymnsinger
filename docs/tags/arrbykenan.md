<tr><td class='hymn-name-box'><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/listing/come_o_thou_traveller.html">Come, O thou Traveler unknown</a></td><td class='lyric-box'>Come, O thou Traveler unknown, whom still, I hold, but cannot see!
My company before is gone, and I am left alone with thee.
With thee all night I mean to stay, and wrestle till the break of day.

I need not tell thee who I am, my misery and sin declare.
Thyself has called me by my name, look on thy hands and read it there.
But who, I ask thee, who art thou? Tell me thy name and tell me now.

In vain thou strugglest to get free;
I never will unloose my hold.
Art thou the Man that died for me?
The secret of thy love unfold.
Wrestling, I will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

Wilt thou not yet to me reveal
thy new, unuerable name?
Tell me, I still beseech thee, tell,
to know it now resolved I am.
Wrestling, I will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

'Tis all in vain to hold thy tongue
or touch the hollow of my thigh.
Though every sinew is unstrung,
out of my arms thou shalt not fly.
Wrestling, I will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

What though my shrinking flesh complain
and murmur to contend so long,
I rise superior to my pain;
when I am weak then I am strong,
and when my all of strength shall fail
I shall with the God-man prevail.

My strength is gone, my nature dies,
I sink beneath thy weighty hand,
faint to revive, and fall to rise.
I fall, and yet by faith AI stand,
I stand and will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

Yield to me now - for I am weak
but confident in self-despair!
Speak to my heart, in blessing speak,
be conquered by my instant prayer.
Speak, or thou never hence shalt move,
and tell me if thy name is Love.

'Tis Love! 'tis Love! thou diedst for me,
I hear thy whisper in my heart.
The morning breaks, the shadows flee,
pure, universal Love thou art.
To me, to all, thy mercies move -
thy nature, and thy name is Love.

My prayer hath power with God;
the grace unspeakable I now receive!
Through faith I see thee face to face,
I see thee face to face, and live!
In vain I have not wept and strove -
thy nature, and thy name is Love.

Contented now upon my thigh
I halt, till life's short journey end.
All helplessness, all weakness I
on thee alone for strength depend,
nor have I power from thee to move.
Thy nature, and thy name is Love!

In pastures fresh you make me feed, beside the living stream.
You bring my wand'ring spirit back, when I farsake your ways,
and lead me for your mercy's sake, in paths of truth and grace.

When I walk through the shades of death, your presence is my stay.
One word of your supporting breath drives all my fears away.
Your hand, in sight of all my foes, does still my table spread.
My cup with blessings overflows, your oil anoints my head.

The sure provisions of my God attend me all my days.
Oh, may your house be my abode, and all my work be praise.
There would I find a settled rest, while others go and come,
no more a stranger, nor a guest, but like a child at home.

no tribe my house can fill;
I sit beside the fount of life
and pour the deluge still.
And gathered by most fragile pow'rs
along the centuries
from race on race the rarest flow'rs
my wreath shall nothing miss.

I wrote the past in characters
of rock and fire and scroll,
the building in the coral sea, the planting of the coal.
And thefts from satellites and rings
and broken stars I drew,
and out of spent and aged things
I formed the world anew.

Must time and tide forever run,
nor winds sleep in the west?
Will ne'er my wheels which whirl the sun
and satellites have rest?
Yet whirl the glowing wheels once more,
and mix the bowl again;
seethe, Fate, the ancient elements,
heat, cold, and peace, and pain.

Blend war and trade and creeds and song,
as ripens human race,
the sunburnt world that they shall breed,
of all my countless days.
No ray is dimmed, no atom worn,
my oldest force is new,
and fresh the rose on yonder thorn
gives back the heav'ns in dew.

It fills the heart with ecstasy,
that God, the Son of God, should take our mortal form for mortals' sake.

For us he was baptized and bore his holy fast, and hungered sore.
For us temptation sharp he knew, for us the tempter overthrew.

For us he prayed, for us he taught. for us his daily works he wrought,
by words and signs and actions thus still seeking not himself but us.

For us to wicked hands betrayed, scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,
he bore the shameful cross and death, for us at length gave up his breath.

Eternal glory to our God for love so deep, so high, so broad;
the Trinity whom we adore forever and forevermore.

forbidden by your God and creed, respected since your youth:
''Prodigal, I'll fight in you, restore your faith to thrive.
I'll bring you back within the fold. Without you can't survive.
Without you can't survive!''

"You'd loose the bond of family!" your instinct diatribes.
Decide: Be shunned to wilderness, or rest in harmless lies.
Act against evolvéd traits? Your logic might agree,
but in your gut, you crave not truth, you crave community.
You crave community!

If earthly fears don't move you, try a sample of Pascal:
A slim chance of eternal bliss is worth more than your all.
Walk along the Roman Road, avoid eternal pain.
Salvation's path is markéd well, with brimstone in the drain,
With brimstone in the drain:

Step one: believe, O wretch, your life is worthless, justly lost,
and second: faith's your only hope, at seemingly no cost!
Third, since faith is proved by work, pay up in duties due:
Two hands on plow, and don't look back, for Brother's watching you.
Your God is watching you!

Mere reason of one mind can't win; the test of time is passed.
Religions of today are the religions fit to last.
Members true through power, fear, or friendly company
instill again in children's minds, "Eat not from yonder tree."
"Eat not from yonder tree!"

'tis a gift to come down where we ought to be.
And when we find ourselves in the place just right
'twill be in the valley of love and delight.

When true simplicity is gained,
to bow and to bend we will not be ashamed;
to turn, turn, will be our delight,
till by turning, turning we come round right.

God will see us through ... some day!
