'tis a gift to come down where we ought to be.
And when we find ourselves in the place just right
'twill be in the valley of love and delight.

When true simplicity is gained,
to bow and to bend we will not be ashamed;
to turn, turn, will be our delight,
till by turning, turning we come round right.

I see you doubt the truth,
the covenant that your faith, your church, imparted in your youth.
Prodigal, I'll work in you, ensure your faith still thrive.
I'll bring you back within the fold. Without you can't survive.
Without you can't survive!

"You doubt your very family!" your instincts diatribe.
Decide: Be shunned to wilderness, or live a harmless lie
Choose against evolvéd traits? Your logic may agree,
but I, your gut, crave not the truth, I crave community.
I crave community!

Is instinct unpersuasive? Try a sample of Pascal:
A slim chance of eternal bliss is worth more than your all.
Take a page from Paul's Epistles, dodge eternal pain.
Salvation's path is markéd well, with brimstone in the drain.
With brimstone in the drain!

To start: believe, O wretch, your life is worthless, justly lost,
and second: faith's your only hope, at seemingly no cost!
Third: pay up in duties due (for faith is proved by work).
Redeem more souls tomorrow. Brother's watching if you shirk.
God's watching if you shirk!

Mere reason of one mind can't win; the test of time is passed.
Religions of today are the religions fit to last.
Members true through power, fear, or friendly company
instill again in children's minds, "Don't eat from yonder tree."
"Don't eat from yonder tree!"
