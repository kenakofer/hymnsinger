<tr><td class='hymn-name-box'><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/listing/come_o_thou_traveller.html">Come, O thou Traveler unknown</a></td><td class='tune-box'>VERNON</td><td class='meter-box'>88.88.88</td><td class='lyric-box'><div>Come, O thou Traveler unknown, whom still, I hold, but cannot see!
My company before is gone, and I am left alone with thee.
With thee all night I mean to stay, and wrestle till the break of day.

I need not tell thee who I am, my misery and sin declare.
Thyself has called me by my name, look on thy hands and read it there.
But who, I ask thee, who art thou? Tell me thy name and tell me now.

In vain thou strugglest to get free;
I never will unloose my hold.
Art thou the Man that died for me?
The secret of thy love unfold.
Wrestling, I will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

Wilt thou not yet to me reveal
thy new, unutterable name?
Tell me, I still beseech thee, tell,
to know it now resolved I am.
Wrestling, I will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

'Tis all in vain to hold thy tongue
or touch the hollow of my thigh.
Though every sinew is unstrung,
out of my arms thou shalt not fly.
Wrestling, I will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

What though my shrinking flesh complain
and murmur to contend so long,
I rise superior to my pain;
when I am weak then I am strong,
and when my all of strength shall fail
I shall with the God-man prevail.

My strength is gone, my nature dies,
I sink beneath thy weighty hand,
faint to revive, and fall to rise.
I fall, and yet by faith AI stand,
I stand and will not let thee go,
till I thy name, thy nature know.

Yield to me now - for I am weak
but confident in self-despair!
Speak to my heart, in blessing speak,
be conquered by my instant prayer.
Speak, or thou never hence shalt move,
and tell me if thy name is Love.

'Tis Love! 'tis Love! thou diedst for me,
I hear thy whisper in my heart.
The morning breaks, the shadows flee,
pure, universal Love thou art.
To me, to all, thy mercies move -
thy nature, and thy name is Love.

My prayer hath power with God;
the grace unspeakable I now receive!
Through faith I see thee face to face,
I see thee face to face, and live!
In vain I have not wept and strove -
thy nature, and thy name is Love.

Contented now upon my thigh
I halt, till life's short journey end.
All helplessness, all weakness I
on thee alone for strength depend,
nor have I power from thee to move.
Thy nature, and thy name is Love!

forbidden by your God and creed, respected since your youth:
''Prodigal, I'll fight in you, restore your faith to thrive.
I'll bring you back within the fold. Without you can't survive.
Without you can't survive!''

"You'd loose the bond of family!" your instinct diatribes.
Decide: Be shunned to wilderness, or rest in harmless lies.
Act against evolvéd traits? Your logic might agree,
but in your gut, you crave not truth, you crave community.
You crave community!

If earthly fears don't move you, try a sample of Pascal:
A slim chance of eternal bliss is worth more than your all.
Walk along the Roman Road, avoid eternal pain.
Salvation's path is markéd well, with brimstone in the drain,
With brimstone in the drain:

Step one: believe, O wretch, your life is worthless, justly lost,
and second: faith's your only hope, at seemingly no cost!
Third, since faith is proved by work, pay up in duties due:
Two hands on plow, and don't look back, for Brother's watching you.
Your God is watching you!

Mere reason of one mind can't win; the test of time is passed.
Religions of today are the religions fit to last.
Members true through power, fear, or friendly company
rebuke again their wayward young, "Eat not from yonder tree."
Eat not from yonder tree!

Singer of Life, you color the earth, dazzling the eye with birds red and bright.
Joy is for us! The flowers are spread! Singing is our delight!

Mortal are we, with all living things, with eagles in the sky.
Even all gold and jade will not last; singing alone, I know, cannot die.
Here in this house of springtime bestow songs that like birds can fly.

Many and great, O God, are your works, maker of earth and sky.
Your hands have set the heavens with stars; your fingers spread the mountains and plains
Lo, at your word the waters were formed; deep seas obey your voice.

Grant unto us communion with you, O starabiding One.
Come unto us and dwell with us; with you are found the gifts of life.
Bless us with life that has no end, eternal life with you.
