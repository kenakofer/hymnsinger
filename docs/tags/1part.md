the covenant that your faith, your church, imparted in your youth.
Prodigal, I'll work in you, ensure your faith still thrive.
I'll bring you back within the fold. Without you can't survive.
Without you can't survive!''

"You doubt your very family!" your instincts diatribe.
Decide: Be shunned to wilderness, or live a harmless lie.
Act against evolvéd traits? Your logic may agree,
but in your gut, you crave not truth, you crave community.
You crave community!

Is instinct unpersuasive? Try a sample of Pascal:
A slim chance of eternal bliss is worth more than your all.
Take a page from Paul's Epistles, dodge eternal pain.
Salvation's path is markéd well, with brimstone in the drain.
With brimstone in the drain!

To start: believe, O wretch, your life is worthless, justly lost,
and second: faith's your only hope, at seemingly no cost!
Third, since faith is proved by work, pay up in duties due:
Two hands on plow, and don't look back, for Brother's watching you.
Your God is watching you!

Mere reason of one mind can't win; the test of time is passed.
Religions of today are the religions fit to last.
Members true through power, fear, or friendly company
instill again in children's minds, "Eat not from yonder tree."
"Eat not from yonder tree!"
