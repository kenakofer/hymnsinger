The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

Thou on my head in early youth didst smile,
And though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,
Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee.
On to the close, O Lord, abide with me.

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death’s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.

Come to Bethlehem and see him whose birth the angels sing.
Come, adore on bended knee Christ, the Lord, the newborn King.

See him in a manger laid whom the angels praise above.
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid, while we raise our hearts in love.

Will you pray with all your power while we try to preach the word?
All is vain unless the Spirit of the holy One comes down.

Sisters, will you come and help us? Moses' sisters aided him.
Will you help the trembling mourners who are struggling hard with sin?
Tell them all about the Savior. Tell them that he will be found.
Sisters pray, and holy manna will be showered all around.

Is there here a trembling jailer, seeking grace and filled with fears?
Is there here a weeping Mary pouring forth a flood of tears?
Brethren join your cries to help them, sisters, let your prayers abound!
Pray, oh pray, that holy manna will be showered all around.

Let us love our God supremely, let us love each other too.
Let us love and pray for sinners till our God makes all things new.
Christ will call us home to heaven. At his table we'll sit down.
Christ will gird himself and serve us with sweet manna all around.

There no foes nor storms assail me, while within the cleft I hide.

  Now I'm resting, sweetly resting, in the cleft once made for me.
  Jesus, blessed Rock of ages, I will hide myself in thee.

Long pursued by sin and Satan, weary, sad, I longed for rest.
Then I found this heav'nly shelter, opened in my Savior's breast.

Wehrlos und verlassen sehnt sich oft mein Herz nach stiller Ruh';
doch du deckest mit dem Fittich deiner Liebe sanft mich zu.

  Unter deinem sanften Fittich find' ich Frieden, Trost und Ruh';
  denn du schirmest mich so freundlich, schützest mich und deckst mich zu.

Drückt mich Kummer, Müh' und Sorge, meine Zuflucht bist nur du,
rettest mich aus allen Ängsten, tröstest mich und deckst mich zu.

Peace which passeth understanding,
joy the world can never give,
now in Jesus, I am finding;
in his smiles of love I live.

In the rifted Rock I'll hide me,
till the storms of life are past
all secure in this blest refuge,
heeding not the fiercest blast.

Sicher bin ich und geborgen,
denn bei dir ist süße Ruh';
mag es auch im Leben stürmen,
Herr, dein Fittich deckt mich zu.

Kommt dann meine letzte Stunde,
geh' ich ein zur ew'gen Ruh';
und du deckst mit deinen Flügeln
ewiglich dein Kindlein zu.

Hearts unfold like flow'rs before thee, praising thee their sun above.
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness; drive the dark of doubt away.
Giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day!

All thy works with joy surround thee, earth and heav'n reflect thy rays,
stars and angels sing around thee, center of unbroken praise.
Field and forest, vale and mountain, blooming meadow, flashing sea,
charting bird and flowing fountain call us to rejoice in thee.

Thou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever bless'd,
wellspring of the joy of living, oceandepth of happy rest!
Thou our Maker, Christ our brother, all who live in love are thine.
Teach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine.

Mortals join the mighty chorus which the morning stars began.
Love divine is reigning o'er us, leading us with mercy's hand.
Ever singing, march we onward, victors in the midst of strife.
Joyful music lifts us sunward in the triumph song of life!

By faith made strong, the rafters will
withstand the battering of the storm.
This hearth, though all the world grow chill,
will keep you warm.

Peace shall walk softly through these rooms,
touching our lips with holy wine,
till ev'ry casual corner blooms
into a shrine.

With laughter drown the raucous shout,
and, though these sheltering walls are thin,
may they be strong to keep hate out
and hold love in.

no tribe my house can fill;
I sit beside the fount of life
and pour the deluge still.
And gathered by most fragile pow'rs
along the centuries
from race on race the rarest flow'rs
my wreath shall nothing miss.

I wrote the past in characters
of rock and fire and scroll,
the building in the coral sea, the planting of the coal.
And thefts from satellites and rings
and broken stars I drew,
and out of spent and aged things
I formed the world anew.

Must time and tide forever run,
nor winds sleep in the west?
Will ne'er my wheels which whirl the sun
and satellites have rest?
Yet whirl the glowing wheels once more,
and mix the bowl again;
seethe, Fate, the ancient elements,
heat, cold, and peace, and pain.

Blend war and trade and creeds and song,
as ripens human race,
the sunburnt world that they shall breed,
of all my countless days.
No ray is dimmed, no atom worn,
my oldest force is new,
and fresh the rose on yonder thorn
gives back the heav'ns in dew.

Why Sun, are you retreating?
The Moon, in dance, now leading
the ancient ballad, Night.
Likewise, a brighter glory
does Truth infuse our story,
when offered soft as yonder light.

Now obligation ceases,
this Night the tired releases
and bids you sleep begin:
My love, there comes a morrow
shall set thee free from sorrow,
and all the anxious toil within.

My loved ones, rest securely,
from ev'ry peril surely
protected be your heads;
and happy slumbers send you,
and ev'ry care attend you,
as trusted souls watch o'er your beds.
