that I may love what thou dost love, and do what thou wouldst do.

Breath on me, breath of God, un-til my heart is pure,
until with thee I will one will, to do and to endure.

Breathe on me, breath of God, till I am wholly thine,
till all this earthly part of me glows with thy fire divine.

Breath on me, breath of God, so shall I never die,
but live with thee the perfect life of thine eternity.

Will you pray with all your power while we try to preach the word?
All is vain unless the Spirit of the holy One comes down.
Brethren pray, and holy manna will be showered all around.

Sisters, will you come and help us? Moses' sisters aided him.
Will you help the trembling mourners who are struggling hard with sin?
Tell them all about the Savior. Tell them that he will be found.
Sisters pray, and holy manna will be showered all around.

Is there here a trembling jailer, seeking grace and filled with fears?
Is there here a weeping Mary pouring forth a flood of tears?
Brethren join your cries to help them, sisters, let your prayers abound!
Pray, oh pray, that holy manna will be showered all around.

Let us love our God supremely, let us love each other too.
Let us love and pray for sinners till our God makes all things new.
Christ will call us home to heaven. At his table we'll sit down.
Christ will gird himself and serve us with sweet manna all around.

each other's cross to bear,
let each his friendly aid afford,
and feel another's care.

Up into thee, our living head,
let us in all things grow,
and by thy sacrifice be led
the fruits of love to show.

Touched by the lodestone of thy love
let all our hearts agree;
and ever toward each other move,
and ever move toward thee.

This is the bond of perfectness,
thy spotless charity.
O let us still, we pray, possess
the mind that was in thee.
