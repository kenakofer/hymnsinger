Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown him Lord of all.
Bring forth the royal diadem, and crown him Lord of all!

O seed of Israel’s chosen race now ransomed from the fall,
hail him who saves you by his grace, and crown him Lord of all.
Hail him who saves you by his grace, and crown him Lord of all!

Let ev’ry tongue and ev’ry tribe responsive to his call,
to him all majesty ascribe, and crown him Lord of all.
To him all majesty ascribe, and crown him Lord of all!

Oh, that with all the sacred throng we at his feet may fall!
We’ll join the everlasting song and crown him Lord of all.
We’ll join the everlasting song and crown him Lord of all!

Fill me with life anew
that I may love what thou dost love, and do what thou wouldst do.

Breath on me, breath of God, un-til my heart is pure,
until with thee I will one will, to do and to endure.

Breathe on me, breath of God, till I am wholly thine,
till all this earthly part of me glows with thy fire divine.

Breath on me, breath of God, so shall I never die,
but live with thee the perfect life of thine eternity.

Will you pray with all your power while we try to preach the word?
All is vain unless the Spirit of the holy One comes down.
Brethren pray, and holy manna will be showered all around.

Sisters, will you come and help us? Moses' sisters aided him.
Will you help the trembling mourners who are struggling hard with sin?
Tell them all about the Savior. Tell them that he will be found.
Sisters pray, and holy manna will be showered all around.

Is there here a trembling jailer, seeking grace and filled with fears?
Is there here a weeping Mary pouring forth a flood of tears?
Brethren join your cries to help them, sisters, let your prayers abound!
Pray, oh pray, that holy manna will be showered all around.

Let us love our God supremely, let us love each other too.
Let us love and pray for sinners till our God makes all things new.
Christ will call us home to heaven. At his table we'll sit down.
Christ will gird himself and serve us with sweet manna all around.

each other's cross to bear,
let each his friendly aid afford,
and feel another's care.

Up into thee, our living head,
let us in all things grow,
and by thy sacrifice be led
the fruits of love to show.

Touched by the lodestone of thy love
let all our hearts agree;
and ever toward each other move,
and ever move toward thee.

This is the bond of perfectness,
thy spotless charity.
O let us still, we pray, possess
the mind that was in thee.

Hearts unfold like flow'rs before thee, praising thee their sun above.
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness; drive the dark of doubt away.
Giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day!

All thy works with joy surround thee, earth and heav'n reflect thy rays,
stars and angels sing around thee, center of unbroken praise.
Field and forest, vale and mountain, blooming meadow, flashing sea,
charting bird and flowing fountain call us to rejoice in thee.

Thou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever bless'd,
wellspring of the joy of living, oceandepth of happy rest!
Thou our Maker, Christ our brother, all who live in love are thine.
Teach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine.

Mortals join the mighty chorus which the morning stars began.
Love divine is reigning o'er us, leading us with mercy's hand.
Ever singing, march we onward, victors in the midst of strife.
Joyful music lifts us sunward in the triumph song of life!

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by.
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light;
the hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above,
while mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wond'ring love.
O morning stars, together proclaim the holy birth!
and praises sing to God the King, and peace to all the earth!

How silently, how silently, the wondrous gift is giv'n!
So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of the heav'ns.
No ear may hear his coming, but in this world of sin,
where meek souls will receive him still the dear Christ enters in.

O holy Child of Bethlehem, descend to us we pray,
cast out our sin, and enter in, be born in us today!
We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell.
O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Immanuel!

and the mountains in reply echoing their brave delight.

  Gloria in excelsis Deo, gloria in excelsis Deo.

Shepherds, why this jebilee? Why these songs of happy cheer?
What great brightness did you see? What glad tidings did you hear?

Come to Bethlehem and see him whose birth the angels sing.
Come, adore on bended knee Christ, the Lord, the newborn King.

See him in a manger laid whom the angels praise above.
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid, while we rais our hearts in love.
