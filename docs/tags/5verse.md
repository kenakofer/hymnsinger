naught be all else to me save that thou art.
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
waking or sleeping thy presence my light.

Be thou my wisdom, be thou my true word;
I ever with thee, and thou with me, Lord.
Thou my great Ma-ker, thy child may I be,
thou in me dwelling, and I one with thee.

Be thou my buckler, my sword for the fight.
Be thou my dignity, thou my delight,
thou my soul's shelter, thou my high tower.
Raise thou me heav'nward, O Pow'r of my pow'r.

Riches I heed not, nor vain, empty praise;
thou mine inheritance, now and always.
Thou and thou only, first in my heart,
high King of heaven, my treasure thou art.

High King of heaven, when vict'ry is won
may I reach heaven's joys, O bright heav'n's Sun!
Heart of my heart, whatever befall,
still be my vision, O Ruler of all.

for the love which from our birth over and around us lies:

  Source of all, to thee we raise this our hymn of grateful praise.

For the beauty of each hour of the day and of the night,
hill and vale and tree and flow'r, sun and moon and stars of light:

For the joy of ear and eye, for the heart and mind's delight,
For the 'me', 'myself', and 'I', conscious links to sound and sight:

For the joy of human care, sibling, partner, parent, child,
friends we've lost and friends still here, for all selfless thoughts and mild:

For thy Truth both harsh and kind, shadowed setter of our stage,
patterns sought by human mind, guiding us from age to age,

with open eye and ear;
I watch afield the farmer load
the bounty of the year.

I filch the fruit of no one's toil—
no trespasser am I—
and yet I reap from every soil
and from the boundless sky

I gather where I did not sow,
and bind the mystic sheaf,
the amber air, the river's flow,
the rustle of the leaf.

A beauty springtime never knew
haunts all the quiet ways,
and sweeter shines the landscape through
its veil of autumn haze.

I face the hills, the streams, the wood,
and feel with all akin;
my heart expands; their fortitude
and peace and joy flow in.

night is drawing nigh,
shadows of the evening
steal across the sky.

Now the leafless landscape
settles in repose,
waiting for the quiet
of the winter snows.

Now as twilight gathers
let us pause and hear
all the slowing pulsebeats
of the waning year.

May the season's rhythms,
slow and strong and deep
soothe the mind and spirit
lulling us to sleep.

Sleep until the rising
of another spring
keeps the the ancient promise
fall and winter bring.

It fills the heart with ecstasy,
that God, the Son of God, should take our mortal form for mortals' sake.

For us he was baptized and bore his holy fast, and hungered sore.
For us temptation sharp he knew, for us the tempter overthrew.

For us he prayed, for us he taught. for us his daily works he wrought,
by words and signs and actions thus still seeking not himself but us.

For us to wicked hands betrayed, scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,
he bore the shameful cross and death, for us at length gave up his breath.

Eternal glory to our God for love so deep, so high, so broad;
the Trinity whom we adore forever and forevermore.

forbidden by your God and creed, respected since your youth:
''Prodigal, I'll fight in you, restore your faith to thrive.
I'll bring you back within the fold. Without you can't survive.
Without you can't survive!''

"You'd loose the bond of family!" your instinct diatribes.
Decide: Be shunned to wilderness, or rest in harmless lies.
Act against evolvéd traits? Your logic might agree,
but in your gut, you crave not truth, you crave community.
You crave community!

If earthly fears don't move you, try a sample of Pascal:
A slim chance of eternal bliss is worth more than your all.
Walk along the Roman Road, avoid eternal pain.
Salvation's path is markéd well, with brimstone in the drain,
With brimstone in the drain:

Step one: believe, O wretch, your life is worthless, justly lost,
and second: faith's your only hope, at seemingly no cost!
Third, since faith is proved by work, pay up in duties due:
Two hands on plow, and don't look back, for Brother's watching you.
Your God is watching you!

Mere reason of one mind can't win; the test of time is passed.
Religions of today are the religions fit to last.
Members true through power, fear, or friendly company
instill again in children's minds, "Eat not from yonder tree."
"Eat not from yonder tree!"

let my people go,
oppressed so hard they could not stand,
let my people go.

  Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt's land,
  tell old Pharaoh: let my people go.

The Lord told Moses what to do,
let my people go,
to lead the Hebrew children through,
let my people go.

As Israel stood by water's side,
let my people go,
at God's command it did divide,
let my people go.

When they had reached the other shore,
let my people go,
they let the song of triumph soar,
let my people go.

Lord, help us all from bondage flee,
let my people go,
and let us all in Christ be free,
let my people go.
