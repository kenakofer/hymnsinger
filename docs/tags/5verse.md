forbidden by your God and creed, respected since your youth:
''Prodigal, I'll fight in you, restore your faith to thrive.
I'll bring you back within the fold. Without you can't survive.
Without you can't survive!''

"You'd loose the bond of family!" your instinct diatribes.
Decide: Be shunned to wilderness, or rest in harmless lies.
Act against evolvéd traits? Your logic might agree,
but in your gut, you crave not truth, you crave community.
You crave community!

Is instinct unpersuasive? Try a sample of Pascal:
A slim chance of eternal bliss is worth more than your all.
Walk along the Roman Road, avoid eternal pain.
Salvation's path is markéd well, with brimstone in the drain,
With brimstone in the drain:

To start: believe, O wretch, your life is worthless, justly lost,
and second: faith's your only hope, at seemingly no cost!
Third, since faith is proved by work, pay up in duties due:
Two hands on plow, and don't look back, for Brother's watching you.
Your God is watching you!

Mere reason of one mind can't win; the test of time is passed.
Religions of today are the religions fit to last.
Members true through power, fear, or friendly company
instill again in children's minds, "Eat not from yonder tree."
"Eat not from yonder tree!"

for the love which from our birth over and around us lies:

  Mother Earth, to thee we raise this our hymn of grateful praise.

For the beauty of each hour of the day and of the night,
hill and vale and tree and flow'r, sun and moon and stars of light:

For the joy of ear and eye, for the heart and mind's delight,
For the 'me', 'myself', and 'I', conscious links to sound and sight:

For the joy of human care, sibling, partner, parent, child,
friends we've lost and friends still here, for all selfless thoughts and mild:

For thy Truth both harsh and kind, shadowed setter of our stage,
patterns sought by human mind, guiding us from age to age,
