  "lyrics": "Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched,\nweak and wounded, sick and sore.\nJesus ready stands to save you,\nfull of pity joined with pow'r:\n\nHe is able, he is able,\nhe is willing; doubt no more.\nHe is able, he is able,\nhe is willing; doubt no more.\n\nCome, ye needy, come and welcome,\nGod's free bounty glorify.\nTrue belief and true repentance,\nev'ry grace that brings you nigh.\n\nWithout money, without money,\ncome to Jesus Christ and buy!\nWithout money, without money,\ncome to Jesus Christ and buy!\n\nCome ye weary, heavy laden,\nbruised and broken by the fall.\nIf you tarry till you're better,\nyou will never come at all:\n\nNot the righteous, not the righteous,\nSinners Jesus came to call.\nNot the righteous, not the righteous,\nSinners Jesus came to call.\n\nLet not conscience make you linger,\nnor of fitness fondly dream;\nall the fitness he requireth\nis to feel your need of him.\n\nThis he gives you, this he gives you,\n'Tis the Spirit's rising beam.\nThis he gives you, this he gives you,\n'Tis the Spirit's rising beam.\n\nLo! th' incarnate God, ascended,\npleads the merit of his blood.\nVenture on him, venture wholly,\nlet no other trust intrude:\nNone but Jesus, none but Jesus\nCan do helpless sinners good.\nNone but Jesus, none but Jesus\nCan do helpless sinners good.\n",
