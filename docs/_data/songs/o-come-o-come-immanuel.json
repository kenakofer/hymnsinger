  "lyrics": "O come, O come, Immanuel,\nand ransom captive Israel,\nthat mourns in lonely exile here,\nuntil the Son of God appear.\n\n  Rejoice! Rejoice!\n  Immanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.\n\nO come, O come, thou God of law,\nin cloud and majesty and awe.\nThy precepts, taught on Sinai's height,\ncall us to lives both just and right.\n\n  Rejoice! Rejoice!\n  Immanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.\n\nO come, thou Rod of Jesse, free\nthine own from Satan's tyranny.\nFrom depths of hell thy people save,\nand give them vict'ry o'er the grave.\nRejoice! Rejoice!\nImmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.\n\nO come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer\nour spirits by thine advent here.\nDisperse the gloomy clouds of night,\nand death's dark shadow put to flight.\nRejoice! Rejoice!\nImmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.\n\nO come, thou Key of David come\nand open wide our heav'nly home.\nMake safe the way that leads to thee\nand close the path to misery.\nRejoice! Rejoice!\nImmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.\n\nO come, thou Wisdom from on high,\nand order all things far and nigh.\nTo us the path of knowledge show,\nand cause us in thy ways to go.\nRejoice! Rejoice!\nImmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.\n\nO come, Desire of nations, bind\nall peoples in one heart and mind.\nBid envy, strife and quarrels cease,\nand fill the world with heaven's peace.\nRejoice! Rejoice!\nImmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.\n",
