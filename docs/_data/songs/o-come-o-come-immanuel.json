Rejoice!\n  Immanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.\n\nO come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer\nour spirits by thine advent here.\nDisperse the gloomy clouds of night,\nand death's dark shadow put to flight.\nRejoice! Rejoice!\nImmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.\n\nO come, Desire of nations, bind\nall peoples in one heart and mind.\nBid envy, strife and quarrels cease,\nand fill the world with heaven's peace.\nRejoice! Rejoice!\nImmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.\n",
