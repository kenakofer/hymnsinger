  "lyrics": "The morning hangs a signal upon the mountain crest,\nwhile all the sleeping valleys in silent darkness rest.\nFrom peak to peak it flashes, it laughs along the sky,\ntill glory of the sunlight on all the land shall lie.\n\nAbove the generations the lonely prophets rise,\nwhile truth flares as the daystar within their glowing eyes,\nand other eyes, beholding, are kindled from that flame;\nand dawn becomes the morning, when prophets love proclaim.\n\nThe soul has lifted moments, above the drift of days,\nwhen life's great meaning breaketh in sunrise on our ways.\nBehold the radiant token of truth above all fear;\nnight shall release its splendor that morning shall appear.\n",
