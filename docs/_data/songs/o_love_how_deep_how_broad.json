  "lyrics": "O love, how deep, how broad, how high! It fills the heart with ecstasy,\nthat God, the Son of God, should take our mortal form for mortals' sake.\n\nFor us he was baptized and bore his holy fast, and hungered sore.\nFor us temptation sharp he knew, for us the tempter overthrew.\n\nFor us he prayed, for us he taught. for us his daily works he wrought,\nby words and signs and actions thus still seeking not himself but us.\n\nFor us to wicked hands betrayed, scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,\nhe bore the shameful cross and death, for us at length gave up his breath.\n\nEternal glory to our God for love so deep, so high, so broad;\nthe Trinity whom we adore forever and forevermore.\n",
