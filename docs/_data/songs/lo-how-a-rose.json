  "lyrics": "Lo, how a Rose e'er blooming from tender stem has sprung!\nOf Jesse's lineage coming as saints of old have sung.\nIt came a flow'ret bright, amid the cold of winter,\nwhen halfspent was the night.\n\nIsaiah 'twas foretold it, the Rose I have in mind.\nWith Mary we behold it, the virgin mother kind.\nTo show God's love aright, she bore to us a Savior,\nwhen halfspent was the night.\n\nFlower, whose fragrance tender with sweetness fills the air,\ndispel in glorious splendor the darkness ev'rywhere.\nHuman, yet very God, from sin and death he saves us,\nand lightens ev'ry load.\n",
