  "lyrics": "My Shepherd will supply my need; most holy is your name.\nIn pastures fresh you make me feed, beside the living stream.\nYou bring my wand'ring spirit back, when I forsake your ways,\nand lead me for your mercy's sake, in paths of truth and grace.\n\nWhen I walk through the shades of death, your presence is my stay.\nOne word of your supporting breath drives all my fears away.\nYour hand, in sight of all my foes, does still my table spread.\nMy cup with blessings overflows, your oil anoints my head.\n\nThe sure provisions of my God attend me all my days.\nOh, may your house be my abode, and all my work be praise.\nThere would I find a settled rest, while others go and come,\nno more a stranger, nor a guest, but like a child at home.\n"
