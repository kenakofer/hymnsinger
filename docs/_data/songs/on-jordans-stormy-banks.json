  "lyrics": "On Jordan's stormy banks I stand and cast a wishful eye\nto Canaan's fair and happy land where my possessions lie.\n\n  I'm bound for the promised land, I'm bound for the promised land;\n  O who will come and go with me? I'm bound for the promised land.\n\nAll o'er those wide extended plains shines one eternal day;\nthere God the Son forever reigns and scatters night away.\n\n  I'm bound for the promised land, I'm bound for the promised land;\n  O who will come and go with me? I'm bound for the promised land.\n\nNo chilling winds nor poisonous breath can reach that healthful shore;\nsickness and sorrow, pain and death are felt and feared no more.\n\n  I'm bound for the promised land, I'm bound for the promised land;\n  O who will come and go with me? I'm bound for the promised land.\n\nWhen shall I reach that happy place and be forever blest?\nWhen shall I see my Father's face and in God's bosom rest?\n\n  I'm bound for the promised land, I'm bound for the promised land;\n  O who will come and go with me? I'm bound for the promised land.\n",
