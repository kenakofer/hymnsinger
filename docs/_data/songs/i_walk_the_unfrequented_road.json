  "lyrics": "I walk the unfrequented road\nwith open eye and ear;\nI watch afield the farmer load\nthe bounty of the year.\n\nI filch the fruit of no one's toil\u2014\nno trespasser am I\u2014\nand yet I reap from every soil\nand from the boundless sky\n\nI gather where I did not sow,\nand bind the mystic sheaf,\nthe amber air, the river's flow,\nthe rustle of the leaf.\n\nA beauty springtime never knew\nhaunts all the quiet ways,\nand sweeter shines the landscape through\nits veil of autumn haze.\n\nI face the hills, the streams, the wood,\nand feel with all akin;\nmy heart expands; their fortitude\nand peace and joy flow in.\n",
