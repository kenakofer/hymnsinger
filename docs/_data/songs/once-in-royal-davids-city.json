  "lyrics": "Once in royal David's city\nstood a lowly cattle shed,\nwhere a mother laid her baby\nin a manger for his bed:\nMary was that mother mild;\nJesus Christ, her little child.\n\nHe came down to earth from heaven\nwho is God and Lord of all,\nand his shelter was a stable,\nand his cradle was a stall;\nwith the poor and meek and lowly,\nlived on earth our Savior holy.\n\nAnd our eyes at last shall see him,\nthrough his own redeeming love;\nfor that child so dear and gentle\nis our Lord in heav'n above;\nand he leads his children on\nto the place where he is gone.\n\nNot in that poor lowly stable\nwith the oxen standing by,\nwe shall see him, but in heaven\nset at God's right hand on high;\nwhen like stars, his children crowned\nall in white, shall wait around.\n",
