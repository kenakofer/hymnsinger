  "lyrics": "May nothing evil cross this door,\nand may ill fortune never pry\nabout these windows; may the roar\nand rain go by.\n\nBy faith made strong, the rafters will\nwithstand the battering of the storm.\nThis hearth, though all the world grow chill,\nwill keep you warm.\n\nPeace shall walk softly through these rooms,\ntouching our lips with holy wine,\ntill ev'ry casual corner blooms\ninto a shrine.\n\nWith laughter drown the raucous shout,\nand, though these sheltering walls are thin,\nmay they be strong to keep hate out\nand hold love in.\n",
