  "lyrics": "When, rising from the bed of death,\no\u2019erwhelmed with guilt and fear,\nI view my Maker face to face,\nO how shall I appear?\nIf yet, while pardon may be found,\nand mercy may be sought,\nmy heart with inward horror shrinks,\nand trembles at the thought.\n\nWhen thou, O Lord, shalt stand disclosed\nin majesty severe,\nand sit in judgement on my soul,\nO how shall I appear?\nBut thou hast told the troubled mind\nwho does her sins lament,\nthe timely tribute of her tears,\nshall endless woe prevent.\n\nThen see the sorrow of my heart,\nere yet it be too late;\nand hear my Saviour\u2019s dying groans,\nto give those sorrows weight.\nFor never shall my soul despair\nher pardon to procure,\nwho knows thine only Son has died\nto make her pardon sure.\n",
