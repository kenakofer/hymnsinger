Jesus lives forevermore.\n\nWhile the world in peace was sleeping,\nearly on that Easter day,\ncame the faithful women, weeping,\nbut the stone was rolled away.\n\n  Hail him! Hail him! Tell the story.\n  Hail! all hail! Jesus lives forevermore.\n\nChrist, our loving mediator,\nnow with God for you and me\nintercedes, and our Creator\nhears and answers ev'ry plea.\n\n  Hail him! Hail him! Tell the story.\n  Hail! all hail! Jesus lives forevermore.\n",
