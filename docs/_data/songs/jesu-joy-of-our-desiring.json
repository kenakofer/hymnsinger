  "lyrics": "Jesu, joy of our desiring, holy wisdom, love most bright,\ndrawn by thee, our souls aspiring soar to uncreated light.\nWord of God, our flesh that fashioned, with the fire of life impassioned,\nstriving still to truth unknown, soaring, dying round thy throne.\n\nThrough the way, where hope is guiding, hark, what peaceful music rings,\nwhere the flock, in thee confiding, drink of joy from deathless springs.\nTheirs is beauty's fairest pleasure. Theirs is wisdom's holiest treasure.\nThou dost ever lead thine own in the love of joys unknown.\n",
