  "lyrics": "On Jordan's stormy banks I stand and cast a wishful eye\nto Canaan's fair and happy land where my possessions lie.\n\n  I'm bound for the promised land, I'm bound for the promised land;\n  O who will come and go with me? I'm bound for the promised land.\n\nThere gen'rous fruits that never fail on trees immortal grow.\nThere rocks and hills and brooks and vales with milk and honey flow.\n\n  I'm bound for the promised land, I'm bound for the promised land;\n  O who will come and go with me? I'm bound for the promised land.\n\nAll o'er those wide extended plains shines one eternnal day.\nThere God the sun forever reigns, and scatters night away.\n\n  I'm bound for the promised land, I'm bound for the promised land;\n  O who will come and go with me? I'm bound for the promised land.\n\nFilled with delight, my raptured soul can here no longer stay.\nThough Jordan's waves around me roll, fearless I'd launch away.\n\n  I'm bound for the promised land, I'm bound for the promised land;\n  O who will come and go with me? I'm bound for the promised land.\n",
