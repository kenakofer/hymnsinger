  "lyrics": "Come, ye thankful people, come, raise a song of harvest home:\nfruit and crops are gathered in, safe before the storms begin;\nGod, our Maker, will provide for our needs to be supplied;\ncome to God's own temple, come, raise a song of harvest home.\n\nAll the world is but a field, given for a fruitful yield;\nwheat and tares together sown, here for joy or sorrow grown:\nfirst the blade, and then the ear, then the full corn shall appear;\nGod of harvest, grant that we wholesome grain and pure may be.\n",
