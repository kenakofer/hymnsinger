From whence shall come my aid?\nMy help is from the Lord alone, who heav'n and earth has made.\n\nGod will not let your foot be moved, your guardian never sleeps.\nGod's watchful and unslumb'ring care protects and safely keeps.\n\nYour faithful keeper is the Lord, your shelter and your shade.\n'Neath sun or moon, by day or night, you shall not be afraid.\n\nFrom evil God will keep you safe, provide for all you need.\nYour going out, your coming in, God will forever lead.\n",
