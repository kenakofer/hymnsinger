  "lyrics": "What Child is this, who, laid to rest, on Mary's lap is sleeping,\nwhom angels greet with anthems sweet, while shepherds watch are keeping?\nThis, this is Christ the King, whom shepherds guard and angels sing.\nHaste, haste to bring him laud, the babe, the son of Mary!\n\nWhy lies he in such mean estate where ox and ass are feeding?\nGood Christian, fear, for sinners here the silent Word is pleading.\nNails, spear shall pierce him through, the cross be borne for me, for you.\nHail, hail the Wordmadeflesh, the babe, the son of Mary!\n\nSo bring him incense, gold, and myrrh, come, peasant, king, to own him.\nThe King of kings salvation brings, let loving hearts enthrone him.\nRaise, raise the song on high; the virgin sings her lullaby.\nJoy, joy for Christ is born, the babe, the son of Mary!\n",
