Fill me with life anew\nthat I may love what thou dost love, and do what thou wouldst do.\n\nBreath on me, breath of God, un-til my heart is pure,\nuntil with thee I will one will, to do and to endure.\n\nBreathe on me, breath of God, till I am wholly thine,\ntill all this earthly part of me glows with thy fire divine.\n\nBreath on me, breath of God, so shall I never die,\nbut live with thee the perfect life of thine eternity.\n",
