And joy be with you all.\n\nOh, all the comrades that 'ere I had,\nare sorry for my going away.\nAnd all the sweethearts that 'ere I had,\nwould wish me one more day to stay.\n\nBut since it falls unto my lot\nthat I should rise and you should not,\nI'll gently rise, and I'll softly call:\nGoodnight! And joy be with you all.\nGoodnight! And joy be with you all.\n",
