  "lyrics": "Now the day is over,\nnight is drawing nigh,\nshadows of the evening\nsteal across the sky.\n\nNow the leafless landscape\nsettles in repose,\nwaiting for the quiet\nof the winter snows.\n\nNow as twilight gathers\nlet us pause and hear\nall the slowing pulsebeats\nof the waning year.\n\nMay the season's rhythms,\nslow and strong and deep\nsoothe the mind and spirit\nlulling us to sleep.\n\nSleep until the rising\nof another spring\nkeeps the ancient promise\nfall and winter bring.\n",
