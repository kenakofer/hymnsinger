  "lyrics": "For the beauty of our earth, for the glory of her skies,\nfor the love which from our birth over and around us lies:\n\n  Source of all, to thee we raise this our hymn of grateful praise.\n\nFor the beauty of each hour of the day and of the night,\nhill and vale and tree and flow'r, sun and moon and stars of light:\n\n  Source of all, to thee we raise this our hymn of grateful praise.\n\nFor the joy of ear and eye, for the heart and mind's delight,\nFor the 'me', 'myself', and 'I', conscious links to sound and sight:\n\n  Source of all, to thee we raise this our hymn of grateful praise.\n\nFor the joy of human care, sibling, partner, parent, child,\nfriends we've lost and friends still here, for all selfless thoughts and mild:\n\n  Source of all, to thee we raise this our hymn of grateful praise.\n\nFor thy Truth both harsh and kind, shadowed setter of our stage,\npatterns sought by human mind, guiding us from age to age,\n\n  Source of all, to thee we raise this our hymn of grateful praise.\n",
