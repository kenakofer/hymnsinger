  "lyrics": "Come, ye faithful, raise the strain of triumphant gladness!\nGod hath brought forth Israel into joy from sadness,\nloosed from Pharaeh's bitter yoke Jacob's sons and daughters,\nled them with unmoistened foot through the Red Sea waters.\n\n'Tis the spring of souls today: Christ hath burst his prison,\nand from three days' sleep in death as a sun hath risen.\nNow rejoice, Jerusalem, and with true affection\nwelcome in unwearied strains Jesus' resurrection.\n\nNeither shall the gates of death, nor the tomb's dark portal,\nnor the watchers, nor the seal hold thee as a mortal.\nBut arisen 'midst thy friends thou didst stand, bestowing\nthy true peace, which evermore passes human knowing.\n",
