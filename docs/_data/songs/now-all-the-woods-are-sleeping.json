  "lyrics": "Now all the woods are sleeping,\nthe night and stillness creeping\no'er city, field, and beast;\nbut thou, my heart, awake be,\nwith pray'rful thanks, attend thee,\nto dearest Treasures ere thou rest.\n\nWhy Sun, are you retreating,\nand Moon, in dance, now leading\nthe ancient ballad, Night?\nReflecting rays, we glisten,\nwe laugh, and talk, and listen,\nresounding, gentle notes of light.\n\nNow obligation ceases,\nthis Night the tired releases\nand bids you sleep begin:\nMy love, there comes a morrow\nshall set thee free from sorrow,\nand all the anxious toil within.\n\nMy loved ones, rest securely,\nfrom ev'ry peril surely\nprotected be your heads;\nand happy slumbers send you,\nand ev'ry care attend you,\nas trusted souls watch o'er your beds.\n",
