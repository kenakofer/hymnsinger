  "lyrics": "Abide with me; Fast falls the eventide,\nThe darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!\nWhen other helpers fail, and comforts flee,\nHelp of the helpless, oh, abide with me.\n\nSwift to its close ebbs out life\u2019s little day;\nEarth\u2019s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;\nChange and decay in all around I see;\nO Thou who changest not, abide with me.\n\nThou on my head in early youth didst smile,\nAnd though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,\nThou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee.\nOn to the close, O Lord, abide with me.\n\nI fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;\nIlls have no weight, and tears no bitterness.\nWhere is death\u2019s sting? Where, grave, thy victory?\nI triumph still, if Thou abide with me.\n",
