  "lyrics": "Bright those jewels of the skies\nwhich in sable darkness glow.\nBrighter in compassion's eyes\nare the silent tears which flow.\n\nSweet the fragrance from the fields\nwhere abundant spices grow.\nSweeter far is that which yields\nsuccor to the sick and low.\n\nGrateful are those gentle dews\non the greening grass which fall.\nFar more grateful what renews\ncomforts to the poor who call\n"
