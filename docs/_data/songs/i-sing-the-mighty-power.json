  "lyrics": "I sing the mighty pow'r of God,\nthat made the mountains rise,\nthat spread the flowing seas abroad\nand built the lofty skies.\nI sing the wisdom that ordained\nthe sun to rule the day.\nThe moon shines full at God's command\nand all the stars obey.\n\nI sing the goodness of the Lord,\nthat filled the earth with food.\nGod formed the creatures with a word,\nand then pronounced them good.\nLord, how thy wonders are displayed,\nwhere'er I turn my eye,\nif I survey the ground I tread,\nor gaze upon the sky!\n\nThere's not a plant or flow'r below,\nbut makes thy glories known,\nand clouds arise, and tempests blow,\nby order from thy throne.\nWhile all that borrows life from thee\nis ever in thy care,\nthere's not a place where we can flee\nbut God is present there.\n",
