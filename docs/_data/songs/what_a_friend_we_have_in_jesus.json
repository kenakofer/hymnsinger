  "lyrics": "What a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and griefs to bear!\nWhat a privilege to carry ev'rything to God in prayer!\nOh, what peace we often forfeit, oh, what needless pain we bear,\nall because we do not carry ev'rything to God in prayer!\n\nHave we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere?\nWe should never be discouraged\u2013 take it to the Lord in prayer!\nCan we find a friend so faithful, who will all our sorrows share?\nJesus knows our ev'ry weakness\u2013 take it to the Lord in prayer!\n\nAre we weak and heavy laden, 'cumbered with a load of care?\nPrecious Savior, still our refuge, take it to the Lord in prayer!\nDo thy friends despise, forsake thee? Take it to the Lord in prayer!\nJesus' arms will take and shield thee\u2013 thou wilt find a solace there.\n",
