  "lyrics": "Child in the manger, infant of Mary,\noutcast and stranger, Lord of all!\nChild who inherits all our transgressions,\nall our demerits on him fall.\n\nMonarchs have tender, delicate children\nnourished in splendor, day by day;\ndeath soon shall banish honor and beauty;\npleasure shall vanish, forms decay.\n\nBut the most holy Child of salvation\ngently and lowly lived below;\nnow as our glorious mighty Redeemer,\nsee him victorious o'er each foe.\n"
