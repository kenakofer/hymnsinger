  "lyrics": "Move in our midst, thou Spirit of God.\nGo with us down from thy holy hill.\nWalk with us through the storm and the calm.\nSpirit of God, go thou with us still.\n\nTouch thou our hands to lead us aright.\nGuide us forever, show us thy way.\nTransform our darkness into thy light.\nSpirit of God, lead thou us today.\n\nStrike from our feet the fetters that bind.\nLift from our lives the weight of our wrong.\nTeach us to love with heart, soul, and mind.\nSpirit of God, thy love makes us strong.\n\nKindle our hearts to burn with thy flame.\nRaise up thy banners high in this hour.\nStir us to build new worlds in thy name.\nSpirit of God, O send us thy pow'r!\n",
