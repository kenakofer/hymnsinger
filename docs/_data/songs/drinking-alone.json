  "lyrics": "One pot of wine amid the flowers\nalone I pour, and none with me.\nThe cup I lift; the Moon invite;\nwho with my Shadow makes us three.\nThough Moon dismiss my offered drink,\nthe Shadow does what I begin.\nAs one, the Shadow, Moon and I\nrejoice, and watch the spring come in.\n\nI sing: and wavers time the Moon.\nI dance: the Shadow antics too.\nOur joys we share while sober still.\nWhen drunk, we part and bid adieu.\nOf loveless outing this the pact,\nsustaining us through cloudy day.\nThe next time that we meet shall be\nbeside yon distant milky way.\n",
