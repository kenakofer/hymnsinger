All is calm, all is bright,\nround yon virgin mother and child, holy Infant, so tender and mild,\nsleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace.\n\nSilent night, holy night! Shepherds quake at the sight,\nglories stream from heaven afar, heav'nly hosts sing: \"Alleluia,\nChrist the Savior is born, Christ the Savior is born.\"\n\nSilent night, holy night! Son of God, love's pure light,\nradiant beams from Thy holy face, with the dawn of redeeming grace,\nJesus, Lord, at Thy birth, Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth.\n\nSilent night, holy night! Wondrous star, lend thy light,\nwith the angels let us sing, Alleluia to our King,\nChrist the Savior is born, Christ the Savior is born.\n",
