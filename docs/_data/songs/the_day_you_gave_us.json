  "lyrics": "The day you gave us, Lord, is ended;\nthe darkness falls at your request.\nTo you our morning hymns ascended;\nyour praise shall sanctify our rest.\n\nWe thank you that your church, unsleeping\nwhile earth rolls onward into light,\nthrough all the world its watch is keeping,\nand never rests by day or night.\n\nAs over continent and island\neach dawn leads on another day,\nthe voice of prayer is never silent,\nnor do the praises die away.\n\nSo be it, Lord, your throne shall never,\nlike earth's proud kingdoms pass away.\nYour kingdom stands and grows forever,\nuntil there dawns your glorious day.\n",
