  "lyrics": "O God in restless living\nwe lose our spirit's peace.\nCalm our unwise confusion,\nbid thou our clamor cease.\nLet anxious hearts grow quiet,\nlike pools at evening still,\ntill thy reflected heavens\nall our spirits fill\n\nTeach us, beyond our striving,\nthe rich rewards of rest\nWho does not live serenely\nis never deeply bless'd.\nO tranquil, radiant Sunlight,\nbring thou our lives to flow'r,\nless wearied with our effort,\nmore aware of pow'r.\n\nReceptive make our spirits,\nour need is to be still.\nAs dawn fades flick'ring candle,\nso dim our anxious will.\nReveal thy radiance through us,\nthine ample strength release.\nNot ours, but thine the triumph\nin the pow'r of peace.\n\nWe grow not wise by struggling,\nwe gain but things by strain.\nWe cease to water gardens\nwhen comes thy plenteous rain.\nO, beautify our spirits\nin restfulness from strife,\nenrich our souls in secret with abundant life.\n",
