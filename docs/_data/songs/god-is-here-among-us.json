  "lyrics": "God is here among us: come with adoration, fervent praise and expectation.\nGod is here within us: known beyond believing, soul in silent awe receiving.\nGod will name and will claim those beheld as lowly, making all things holy.\n\nCome, abide within me; let my soul, like Mary, be thine earthly sanctuary.\nCome, indwelling Spirit, with transfigured splendor; love and honor will I render.\nWhere I go here below, let me bow before thee, know thee, and adore thee.\n\nGladly we surrender earth's deceitful treasures, pride of life, and sinful pleasures.\nGod, we gladly offer thine to be forever, soul and life and each endeavor.\nThou alone shalt be known Lord of all our being, life's true way decreeing.\n",
