Great is thy faithfulness!\n  Morning by morning new mercies I see.\n  All I have needed thy hand hath provided.\n  Great is thy faithfulness! Lord unto me!\n\nSummer and winter, and springtime and harvest,\nsun, moon, and stars in their courses above,\njoin with all nature in manifold witness\nto thy great faithfulness, mercy, and love.\n\n  Great is thy faithfulness! Great is thy faithfulness!\n  Morning by morning new mercies I see.\n  All I have needed thy hand hath provided.\n  Great is thy faithfulness! Lord unto me!\n\nPardon for sin and a peace that endureth,\nthine own dear presence to cheer and to guide,\nstrength for today and bright hope for tomorrow;\nblessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!\n\n  Great is thy faithfulness! Great is thy faithfulness!\n  Morning by morning new mercies I see.\n  All I have needed thy hand hath provided.\n  Great is thy faithfulness! Lord unto me!\n",
