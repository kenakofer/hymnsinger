  "lyrics": "Amazing grace! how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me!\nI once was lost, but now am found, was blind, but now I see.\n\n'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved.\nHow precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed.\n\nThrough many dangers, toils, and snares, I have already come.\n'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home.\n\nYes, when this flesh and heart shall fail, and mortal life shall cease,\nI shall possess, within the vail, a life of joy and peace.\n\nThe earth shall soon dissolve like snow, the sun forbear to shine;\nbut God, who called me here below, will be forever mine.\n\nWhen we've been there ten thousand years, bright shining as the sun,\nwe've no less days to sing God's praise than when we'd first begun.\n",
