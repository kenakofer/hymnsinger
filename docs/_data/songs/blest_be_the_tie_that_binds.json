  "lyrics": "Blest be the tie that binds our hearts in Christian love.\nThe fellowship of kindred minds is like to that above.\n\nWe share each other's woes, each other's burdens bear,\nand often for each other flows the sympathizing tear.\n\nWhen we asunder part, it gives us inward pain,\nbut we shall still be joined in heart, and hope to meet again.\n\nFrom sorrow, toil, and pain, and sin we shall be free,\nand perfect love and friendship reign through all eternity.\n"
