  "lyrics": "No number tallies up my score,\nno tribe my house can fill;\nI sit beside the fount of life\nand pour the deluge still.\nAnd gathered by most fragile pow'rs\nalong the centuries\nfrom race on race the rarest flow'rs\nmy wreath shall nothing miss.\n\nI wrote the past in characters\nof rock and fire and scroll,\nthe building in the coral sea, the planting of the coal.\nAnd thefts from satellites and rings\nand broken stars I drew,\nand out of spent and aged things\nI formed the world anew.\n\nMust time and tide forever run,\nnor winds sleep in the west?\nWill ne'er my wheels which whirl the sun\nand satellites have rest?\nYet whirl the glowing wheels once more,\nand mix the bowl again;\nseethe, Fate, the ancient elements,\nheat, cold, and peace, and pain.\n\nBlend war and trade and creeds and song,\nas ripens human race,\nthe sunburnt world that they shall breed,\nof all my countless days.\nNo ray is dimmed, no atom worn,\nmy oldest force is new,\nand fresh the rose on yonder thorn\ngives back the heav'ns in dew.\n"
