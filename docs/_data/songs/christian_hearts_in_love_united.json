  "lyrics": "Christian hearts in love united:\nsearch to know God's holy will.\nLet his love in us ignited,\nmore and more our spirits fill.\nChrist the head, and we his members\u2014\nwe reflect the light he is.\nChrist the master, we disciples\u2014\nhe is ours, and we are his.\n\nGrant, lord, that with your direction,\n''Love each other'' we comply.\nHelp us live in true affection,\nyour love to exemplify.\nLet our mutual love be glowing\nbrightly so that all may view\nthat we, as on one stem growing,\nliving branches are in you.\n\nCome, then, living church of Jesus,\ncovenant with him anew.\nUnto him who conquered for us\nmay we pledge our service true.\nMay our lives reflect the brightness\nof God's love in Jesus shown.\nTo the world we then bear witness:\nwe belong to God alone.\n"
