  "lyrics": "Joyful, joyful, we adore thee, God of glory, Lord of love.\nHearts unfold like flow'rs before thee, praising thee their sun above.\nMelt the clouds of sin and sadness; drive the dark of doubt away.\nGiver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day!\n\nAll thy works with joy surround thee, earth and heav'n reflect thy rays,\nstars and angels sing around thee, center of unbroken praise.\nField and forest, vale and mountain, blooming meadow, flashing sea,\ncharting bird and flowing fountain call us to rejoice in thee.\n\nThou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever bless'd,\nwellspring of the joy of living, oceandepth of happy rest!\nThou our Maker, Christ our brother, all who live in love are thine.\nTeach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine.\n\nMortals join the mighty chorus which the morning stars began.\nLove divine is reigning o'er us, leading us with mercy's hand.\nEver singing, march we onward, victors in the midst of strife.\nJoyful music lifts us sunward in the triumph song of life!\n",
