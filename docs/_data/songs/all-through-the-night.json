  "lyrics": "Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee\nall through the night.\nGuardian angels God will send thee\nall through the night.\nSoft the drowsy hours are creeping,\nhill and vale in slumber sleeping,\nI my loving vigil keeping,\nall through the night.\n\nWhile the moon her watch is keeping\nall through the night.\nWhile the weary world is sleeping\nall through the night.\nO'er thy spirit gently stealing,\nvisions of delight revealing,\nbreaths a pure and holy feeling,\nall through the night.\n\nDeep the silence round us spreading,\nall through the night.\nDark the path that we are treading,\nall through the night.\nStill the coming day discerning,\nby the hope within us burning,\nto the dawn our fottsteps turning\nall through the night.\n\nStar of faith the dark adorning,\nall through the night.\nLeads us fearless toward the morning,\nall through the night.\nThough our hearts be wrapped in sorrow,\nfrom the home of dawn we borrow,\npromise of a new tomorrow,\nall through the night.\n",
