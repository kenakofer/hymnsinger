### Musical copyright rant

The good:

1. Copyright does help people protect their works from change or distribution.
1. Copyright does often incentivize and reward creative innovation
    1. Honestly not sure if this increases the quantity or quality of works,
    but one can't argue too much with the supply and demand in the free market!
1. Gotta keep your baby safe!

The bad:

1. Shouldn't keep your baby locked up for life + 70 years. Let it live a little!
1. Content innovation may be locked, but so is format/accessibility innovation
1. Discovering copyright details is difficult when all you see in a ©
    1. Permissive copyrights are seldom used (maybe?), hard to know.
1. Copyright encourages people to live in fear (utter depravity link?)
1. Copyright is too long

1. It's too easy to make minor alterations/translations and copyright the difference
    1. maybe leave this one out. To the same extent those alterations are
    easy, omitting or redoing the alterations differently is usually trivial

My 3 far-fetched wishes:
1. Copyright term reduced to life + 25 (I'd settle for life + 50 (the [Berne
Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention) minimum) as a
realistic goal.
1. The typical creator seriously considers using Creative Commons instead of
"all rights reserved" for community-oriented works, and are celebrated for
doing so.
1. Rather than a single © symbol and the copyright holder, we need a norm to
specify details of what the creator would like to permit, or a link to such
details. These could be abbreviated such that the printed statement is not
too long and only those who care need to know. The CC license banners do well
at encoding some common license desires.



Other sites:
- Fees/Logins required, even for public domain content!
- materials sparse
- Site itself is lifeless
- When there are pdfs at all, they are often lacking
- IMSLP is amazing in its breadth of works, but not always of the highest quality or presentation
