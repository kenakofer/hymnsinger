%% LYRICS
verseA = \lyricmode {
  \l The sands of time are sink -- ing,
  the dawn of hea -- ven breaks.
  the sum -- mer morn I've sighed for,
  the fair sweet morn a -- wakes;
  dark, dark hath been the mid -- night,
  but day -- spring is at hand,
  and glo -- ry, glo -- ry dwell -- eth
  in Em -- man -- uel's land.
}
verseB = \lyricmode {
  The King there in his bea -- ty
  with -- out a veil is seen;
  it were a well -- spent jour -- ney,
  though sev'n deaths lay be -- tween:
  the Lamb with his fair ar -- my
  doth on Mount Zi -- on stand.
  and glo -- ry, glo -- ry dwell -- eth
  in Em -- man -- uel's land.
}
verseC = \lyricmode {
  O Christ, he is the foun -- tain,
  the deep sweet well of love!
  The streams on earth I've tast -- ed,
  more deep I'll drink a -- bove:
  there to an o -- cean full -- ness
  his mer -- cy doth ex -- pand,
  and glo -- ry, glo -- ry dwell -- eth
  in Em -- man -- uel's land.
}
verseD = \lyricmode {
  The bride eyes not her gar -- ment,
  but her dear bride -- groom's face;
  I will not gaze at glo -- ry,
  but on my King of grace;
  not at the crown he gift -- eth,
  but on his pier -- c√®d hand:
  the Lamb is all the glo -- ry
  of Em -- man -- uel's land.
