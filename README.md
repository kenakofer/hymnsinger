## Private Hymn Singer Docker Image

For building and self-hosting your own private collection of sheet music with basic apache2 password protection. (For what it's worth since you can't log in, <p.hymnsinger.com> is Kenan's personal instance.)

## TODO
fix source code link on song page
push changes to branch of public repo
Make hymn singer branding less in your face
Support simply pushing to the pi and the pi runs the build steps
Add lilypond build image step (Could be useful on the github pages side too, just saying.)
I think docker flow is supposed to be like: you usually don't have to *rebuild* an image to use it in a typical way, but just *rerun* it. I wonder is there's a way to adapt the flow so changing site content doesn't need a rebuild.
