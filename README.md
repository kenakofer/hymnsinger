## Hymn Hosting

This is a project to make or take hymns with permissive copyright status, typeset them with lilypond in a variety of formats, and serve them online in a friendly and usable github pages site. It has a long ways to go yet.

### Features of the site include:
 - Easy browsing of the full hymn selection
 - An interface for simultaneously viewing and playing the hymn
     - Ability to change volume on a per-part basis
 - Multiple formats supported
   Full mobile support (issues with android firefox at the moment)
 - I can add new songs easily

### Possible TODOs:
 - Differentiate fonts png versus pdf?
   Change hymn text locations
 - Email lilypond list regarding shape notes + partsCombine
 - Typeset more hymns/tunes
    - Amazing grace tune, possibly with the alternative lyrics
    - Melody of slowly turning (Make your own harmonization and lyrics, even though the originals are so good...)
   Stem default directions down/up?
   CSS tweaks:
    - Fix large/small screen differences
   Midiplayer tweaks:
      Show tempo on file load
      Don't reset tempo on play start (inhibit tempo event)
      Don't start playing on tempo change
      Change stop to restart
      Figure out if dragging through the file is possible
      Fix play/pause indication
      Loop play?
      Add master volume slider
      Add pitch change slider
      Add Instrument change option
      Add expandable advanced panel, place most things inside to avoid clutter
    Find in page doesn't work on mobile, maybe just suggest using find in page? Or use a better library
    Play sample on the index page?
    Fix playback on mobile firefox
    Screenshot on home page showing e.g. amazing grace old and new.
    Sort index page somehow
    Tag hymns/Set up tag pages
