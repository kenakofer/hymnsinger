## Private Hymn Singer Docker Image

For building and self-hosting your own private collection of sheet music with password protection.

## TODO
fix source code link on song page
parameterize domain name
push changes to branch of public repo
Make hymn singer branding less in your face
Support simply pushing to the pi and the pi runs the build steps
Add lilypond build image step (Could be useful on the github pages side too, just saying.)
