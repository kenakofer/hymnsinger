### Hymn Hosting

This is a project to make or take hymns with permissive copyright status, typeset them with lilypond in a variety of formats, and serve them online in a friendly and usable github pages site. It has a long ways to go yet.

Features of the site should include:
 - Easy browsing of the full hymn selection
 - An interface for simultaneously viewing and playing the hymn
     - Links to editing the Lilypond source
     - Ability to change volume on a per-part basis
 - Add new songs easily
 - Multiple formats supported
